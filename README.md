# SpotifyCSV

Have you ever wondered what would happen to your spotify music playlists if spotify anounced they were going under?
How would you save your playlists? Where would you save your playlists?

This application will save any designated playlist from spotify to a csv file named after the spotify playlist's ID

A UI will need to be created for this application to be practical

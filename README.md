# SpotifyCSV

Have you ever wondered what would happen to your spotify music playlists if spotify anounced they were going under?
How would you save your playlists? Where would you save your playlists?

This application will save any designated playlist from spotify to a csv file named after the spotify playlist's ID

A UI will need to be created for this application to be practical

Insert the playlist id.


Once you hit enter the program will creat a csv file with all of the content from that playlist!



# Fixes
1. CSV file naming/creation to not replace the old file.
2. Playlist ID retrieval from users personal playlist selections using GUI
